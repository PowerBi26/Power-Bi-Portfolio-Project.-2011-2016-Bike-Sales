# Power-Bi-Portfolio-Project.-2011-2016-Bike-Sales
In this Project, I cleaned the data and prepared the columns that will be needed for anaylis. 
Then with the prepared data, I made visualizations that highlight insights suchs as:
Profit Report,
Total Profit earned for each product, 
Sales Report,
Cost of Business Operation Report, and
Customers Purchase Behavior.
